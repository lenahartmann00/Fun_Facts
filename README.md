# Fun_Facts
Show some fun facts with this android app

## Description
This app shows a new fun fact and changes the background color everytime the button is clicked. It contains over a hundret fun facts.

## What I learned
- Changing the background color
- Adapting the statusbar color to the background color
- Using the Relative Layout
- Setting a fullscreen theme
- Java backend (create random numbers to show different fun facts (saved in an array), using a Queue to prevent the app from showing the same fun fact multiple times in a row, ...)
